;; The core idea with :app-db/update-path and :app-db/update-path-blur
;; is that we need to separate the users text input (`path-str`) with the
;; parsing of that string (`path`). We let the user type any string that
;; they like, and check it for validity on each change. If it is valid
;; then we update `path` and mark the pod as valid. If it isn't valid then
;; we don't update `path` and mark the pod as invalid.
;;
;; On blur of the input, we reset path-str to the last valid path, if
;; the pod isn't currently valid.
