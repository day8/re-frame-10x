;; -- Interceptors --------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Interceptors are a more advanced topic. So, we're plunging into the deep
;; end here.
;;
;; There is a tutorial on Interceptors in re-frame's `/docs`, but to get
;; you going fast, here's a very high level description ...
;;
;; Every event handler can be "wrapped" in a chain of interceptors. A
;; "chain of interceptors" is actually just a "vector of interceptors". Each
;; of these interceptors can have a `:before` function and an `:after` function.
;; Each interceptor wraps around the "handler", so that its `:before`
;; is called before the event handler runs, and its `:after` runs after
;; the event handler has run.
;;
;; Interceptors with a `:before` action, can be used to "inject" values
;; into what will become the `coeffects` parameter of an event handler.
;; That's a way of giving an event handler access to certain resources,
;; like values in LocalStore.
;;
;; Interceptors with an `:after` action, can, among other things,
;; process the effects produced by the event handler. One could
;; check if the new value for `app-db` correctly matches a Spec.
;;

;; -- First Interceptor ------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Event handlers change state, that's their job. But what happens if there's
;; a bug in the event handler and it corrupts application state in some subtle way?
;; Next, we create an interceptor called `check-spec-interceptor`.
;; Later, we use this interceptor in the interceptor chain of all event handlers.
;; When included in the interceptor chain of an event handler, this interceptor
;; runs `check-and-throw` `after` the event handler has finished, checking
;; the value for `app-db` against a spec.
;; If the event handler corrupted the value for `app-db` an exception will be
;; thrown. This helps us detect event handler bugs early.
;; Because all state is held in `app-db`, we are effectively validating the
;; ENTIRE state of the application after each event handler runs.  All of it.

(defn check-and-throw
  "Throws an exception if `db` doesn't match the Spec `a-spec`."
  [a-spec db]
  (when-not (s/valid? a-spec db)
    (throw (ex-info (str "spec check failed: " (s/explain-str a-spec db)) {}))))

;; now we create an interceptor using `after`
(def check-spec-interceptor (after (partial check-and-throw :todomvc.db/db)))

;; -- Second Interceptor -----------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Part of the TodoMVC challenge is to store todos in local storage.
;; Next, we define an interceptor to help with this challenge.
;; This interceptor runs `after` an event handler, and it stores the
;; current todos into local storage.
;; Later, we include this interceptor into the interceptor chain
;; of all event handlers which modify todos.  In this way, we ensure that
;; every change to todos is written to local storage.
(def ->local-store (after todos->local-store))

;; -- Interceptor Chain ------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Each event handler can have its own chain of interceptors.
;; We now create the interceptor chain shared by all event handlers
;; which manipulate todos.
;; A chain of interceptors is a vector of interceptors.
;; Explanation of the `path` Interceptor is given further below.
(def todo-interceptors [check-spec-interceptor              ;; ensure the spec is still valid  (after)
                        (path :todos)                       ;; the 1st param given to handler will be the value from this path within db
                        ->local-store])                     ;; write todos to localstore  (after)

;; -- Helpers -----------------------------------------------------------------

(defn allocate-next-id
  "Returns the next todo id.
  Assumes todos are sorted.
  Returns one more than the current largest id."
  [todos]
  ((fnil inc 0) (last (keys todos))))

;; -- Event Handlers ----------------------------------------------------------

;; usage:  (dispatch [:initialise-db])
;;
;; This event is dispatched in the app's `main` (core.cljs).
;; It establishes initial application state in `app-db`.
;; That means merging:
;;   1. Any todos stored in LocalStore (from the last session of this app)
;;   2. Default initial values
;;
;; Advanced topic:  we inject the todos currently stored in LocalStore
;; into the first, coeffect parameter via use of the interceptor
;;    `(inject-cofx :local-store-todos)`
;;
;; To fully understand this advanced topic, you'll have to read the tutorials
;; and look at the bottom of `db.cljs` for the `:local-store-todos` cofx
;; registration.

   {:db (assoc default-db :todos local-store-todos)}))     ;; all hail the new state to be put in app-db

;; usage:  (dispatch [:set-showing  :active])
;; This event is dispatched when the user clicks on one of the 3
;; filter buttons at the bottom of the display.

  ;; only one interceptor
 [check-spec-interceptor]                                  ;; after event handler runs, check app-db for correctness. Does it still match Spec?

  ;; handler

            (assoc db :showing new-filter-kw)))

;; NOTE: below is a rewrite of the event handler (above) using a `path` Interceptor
;; You'll find it illuminating to compare this rewrite with the original.
;;
;; A `path` interceptor has BOTH a before and after action.
;; When you create one, you supply "a path" into `app-db`, like:
;; [:a :b 1]
;; The job of "before" is to replace the app-db with the value
;; of `app-db` at the nominated path. And, then, "after" to
;; take the event handler returned value and place it back into
;; app-db at the nominated path.  So the event handler works
;; with a particular, narrower path within app-db, not all of it.
;;
;; So, `path` operates a little like `update-in`
;;
#_(reg-event-db

   [check-spec-interceptor (path :showing)]

    ;; The event handler
    ;; Because of the `path` interceptor above, the 1st parameter to
    ;; the handler below won't be the entire 'db', and instead will

 todo-interceptors

  ;; The event handler function.
  ;; The "path" interceptor in `todo-interceptors` means 1st parameter is the
  ;; value at `:todos` path within `db`, rather than the full `db`.
  ;; And, further, it means the event handler returns just the value to be
  ;; put into the `[:todos]` path, and not the entire `db`.
  ;; So, againt, a path interceptor acts like clojure's `update-in`
